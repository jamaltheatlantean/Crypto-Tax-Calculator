## ABOUT THIS PROJECT
A simple crypto tax calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## FEATURES
-   Calculates the tax owed on every crypto purchase and sale by multiplying capital gain by tax rate. Current tax rate is 0.15 but feel free to adjust to any tax rate you want.
-   Uses BitQuery's Historical API to fetch price data on the date that the crypto currency was purchased.
